## esp32 home module
Ah, the wonders of modern technology. I, Sherlock Holmes, am delighted to announce the deployment of a new feature for our gate module - the ability to press a button and have an image of the visitor sent to the home module. Not only will this display the image in real time on its display, but with the push of a button, you can either open or close the door, or even press an SOS button. Furthermore, it is portable, compatible, and consumes less power, without any complex wiring.
## New Feature
Sherlock Holmes here! I am pleased to announce the release of a new feature - the door module. This feature allows you to open your door with just a press of a button at the gate module. When the button is pressed, the gate module will send a picture to the home module, allowing you to view who is at the door before opening it. This feature is sure to be an invaluable addition to any home security system. With this feature, you can now know exactly who is at the door without having to physically see them.

The new feature allows the display to show an image of the visitor in real-time. This feature is enabled using the latest camera technology that captures a live image of the visitor when they approach the display. The image of the visitor is then magnified and displayed on the screen, allowing for better identification. This feature will help improve the security of the premises by providing a more accurate way to identify visitors. It can also be used to verify the identity of visitors more quickly and easily. The image is updated in real-time, so any changes in the visitor's appearance are immediately reflected on the display.

Greetings, my fellow detectives! I have a new feature to share with you all. With this feature, you will be able to know exactly who is at your door in real-time. It uses the latest technology to detect motion and sound outside your door and alert you of any visitors. This feature also allows you to view live video streams of whoever is knocking at your door. You can now see who is there directly from your smartphone or tablet. This feature offers you extra security and convenience by allowing you to control who comes in and out of your home. So get ready to find out who's at your door in real-time!

My dear Watson, I am delighted to announce a new feature that will make your life easier. With a push of a button, you can now open or close the door with ease. Not only that, but if you find yourself in an emergency, you can press the SOS button which will alert your family and friends. This feature is designed to give you a sense of safety and security when you are away from home. I hope this will help make your life a little bit easier.

The new feature I have implemented allows direct connection to the gate module with its own network. No longer will you need to worry about the complexity of having to access the gate module through a third-party network. With this new feature, the connection is secure and direct, allowing for a more seamless experience. This will help reduce the risk of being disconnected and provide a more reliable connection. Additionally, it will also enhance the overall performance of the system as the direct connection eliminates any latency issues that may be experienced when using a third-party network.

Introducing the new and improved portable feature! No more worries about being stuck in one place. You can now take your data with you wherever you go. This feature allows you to store your data on a portable device and access it from anywhere. It also keeps your data safe and secure, so you don't have to worry about it being compromised. With this feature, you can easily transfer data between devices and access it from any computer or mobile device. So why wait? Get the most out of your data today with this new and improved portable feature.

Good day, my dear Watson! Today I am pleased to announce the newest feature of our product: compatibility. Our users will now be able to enjoy more seamless experiences as they use our product in combination with other products. With this new feature, users can expect their interactions with our product and other products to be smoother and more efficient. We are confident that this feature will make the user experience even better, allowing users to take full advantage of all the features our product has to offer. The compatibility will also help us provide a higher quality of service to our customers, ensuring that they get the most out of their interactions with our product. So, what are you waiting for? Give it a try and see

The new feature I'm introducing is an improvement in power consumption. This will allow for more efficient usage of electricity, resulting in a reduction of energy costs and improved sustainability. Furthermore, this change will help reduce the environmental impact of our products. With this new feature, users can expect to see a decrease in their power bills and a decrease in their carbon footprint. Ultimately, this will lead to a better future for us all.

This new feature allows users to take advantage of our wireless technology, meaning that they can connect to any device without having to worry about complex wiring. This will simplify the process of setting up connections and make it much easier for users to get the most out of their devices. With this feature, users won't have to suffer trying to figure out which wire goes where - they can just connect and be done with it! We hope that this new feature will revolutionize the way people use their devices, making it simpler and more convenient than ever before.

Ah, what a delightfully convenient invention! With the press of a button, no longer must one worry about who is at the door. The gate module sends a picture to the home module, which in turn displays an image of the visitor in real-time. One can then decide to open or close the door with another press of the button or call for help with the SOS button. Furthermore, the device is portable and compatible and consumes less power than other similar devices. What a relief - no need for complex wiring. A brilliant advancement indeed!

## Installation
```Arduino Uno IDE```
just download a zip file of the repository and extract and import it to IDE and install the libraries required for the project

compile it and select the right board and partition scheme and then select the right port and then hit the upload button;

```Platform.io```
As I personally work on platform.io cause it is too handy and easy to use as it is the extension of VS studio code so first thing first follows the link to install the platform.io properly.
